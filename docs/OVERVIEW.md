# Overview 

This repo contains some relatively basic functionality for working with CTD data in Python. It relies on the functionality in the [`kval`](https://github.com/NPIOcean/kval) library (formerly `oceanograpy`). `kval` is under development and somewhat in the middle of a refactoring, so do not expect everything to work seamlessly..

### Mamba environment / `yml` file

This file contains specification for building a mamba environment with `kval` installed (see [Setup](SETUP.md))
